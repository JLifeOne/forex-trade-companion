### 1. Introduction & Vision

#### 1.1. Product Overview
The Forex Trade Companion is a comprehensive, AI-enhanced web application designed to be the ultimate, all-in-one dashboard for modern Forex traders. It centralizes all critical aspects of the trading workflow—from market analysis and charting to execution, in-depth journaling, performance analytics, and account management.

#### 1.2. Vision Statement
To empower Forex traders of all levels with a sophisticated, data-driven, and AI-powered platform that fosters discipline, provides actionable insights through advanced tools, and helps them make more informed trading decisions to improve their long-term profitability and consistency.

#### 1.3. Problem Statement
Forex trading is complex, dis-jointed, and emotionally taxing. Traders struggle with:
*   **Tool Sprawl:** Juggling separate platforms for charting, news, journaling, and analytics, leading to inefficiency and missed opportunities.
*   **Lack of Discipline:** Deviating from trading plans due to emotional decision-making.
*   **Analysis Paralysis:** Difficulty in identifying high-probability setups and filtering market noise.
*   **Performance Blindness:** Inability to effectively analyze past trades to identify recurring patterns, strengths, and weaknesses.
*   **Tedious Record-Keeping:** Manual journaling is time-consuming and prone to errors, often leading to abandonment.

The Forex Trade Companion solves these problems by providing a single, integrated, and intelligent workspace.

### 2. User Flow & Monetization Strategy

The application will employ a freemium model designed to provide significant value at the free level to build user trust and engagement, while creating a compelling, non-intrusive upgrade path.

#### 2.1. Initial User Journey
1.  **Visitor:** A new, unauthenticated user can browse the application's interface in a read-only or limited state. They can see the layout, view mock data, and understand the potential features.
2.  **Account Creation:** To use any interactive features (journaling, checklist, watchlist), the user must create a free account (email/password).
3.  **Plan Selection:** Upon first login, the user is presented with the subscription tiers (Free, Starter, Pro). The "Free" plan is pre-selected, allowing them to proceed without payment, or they can choose to upgrade immediately.

#### 2.2. Subscription Tiers
*   **Free (The Apprentice):** Focused on building core habits. Provides essential tools for journaling and basic market awareness.
*   **Starter (The Trader):** For the dedicated trader looking to improve performance with deeper data analysis and more powerful AI assistance.
*   **Pro (The Master):** For the serious trader who requires professional-grade tools for peak efficiency, advanced analysis, and workflow automation.
*   **Expert (The Quant):** For power users and small teams who need API access for custom integrations and programmatic trading.

#### 2.3. Account Management
A dedicated "Account Settings" section will allow authenticated users to:
*   **Update Profile:** Change their name, email, or password.
*   **Manage Subscription:**
    *   View current plan, billing cycle, and next payment date.
    *   **Upgrade Plan:** Select a higher tier. The upgrade takes effect immediately upon successful payment, prorating the cost if applicable.
    *   **Downgrade Plan:** Select a lower tier. The user retains access to their current plan's features until the end of the paid billing cycle, after which the new, lower-tier plan becomes active.
    *   **Cancel Subscription:** The cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle. The user retains access to their paid features until that date.
*   **Update Billing Information:** Manage credit card details via an integrated, secure payment provider (e.g., Stripe, Braintree).

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The application, especially the charting hub, must be highly performant and responsive with minimal latency.
*   **Security:** All user data, especially authentication tokens and broker credentials, must be encrypted and stored securely. Payment processing will be handled by a PCI-compliant third-party provider.
*   **Scalability:** The backend architecture must be serverless and scalable to handle a growing user base and intensive AI processing tasks.
*   **UI/UX:** A clean, modern, and intuitive dark-themed interface that is easy on the eyes and reduces cognitive load for traders during long sessions.
*   **Reliability:** The application must have high uptime, with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for external services (e.g., news feeds, AI API).
